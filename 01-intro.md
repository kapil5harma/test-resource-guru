# Resource Guru engineering code challenge

Thank you for your interest in joining Resource Guru's engineering team. The next step in the process is for you
to complete the code challenge described below.

Take as much or as little time as you need. We understand you may have other commitments and time constraints as
well. Please let us know roughly when we should expect your answers (e.g. "next Monday") and let us know if you
need more time.

### What we're looking for

The details matter. Tests are expected, as is well written, simple idiomatic code. A good submission will be
self explanatory, the tests will be good documentation for the code and it will gracefully handle strange or
invalid inputs. Functions will have clearly defined responsibilities. Test cases cover likely problems with
input data.

We suggest you work in a separate Git repository per exercise, and commit after each step so that we can follow
your thinking more clearly. We prefer that you submit your solution using Github or Bitbucket.
